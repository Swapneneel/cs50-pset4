//Notes for the implementation of Recover File
*** Primary steps::
****** Open memory card
******** || FILE *card = fopen(argv[1], "r"); // check for null return
****** find begining of JPEG
******** || fread(&file, sizeof(JPEG), 512, card);
****** open a new JPEG
****** write 512 bytes at a time until new JPEG is found
<<<<<<< HEAD
****** detect end of file


***File opening permission "a" == append is very usefull and it will hep the file already opened to modify
 further.
